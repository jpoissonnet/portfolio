# A school context

This project was a school project tutored by a teacher that liked to go hiking a lot.
He wanted to create a web app that would help him plan and manage his hiking trips.
He wanted to be able to create a trip, add waypoints to it, and then be able to manage the budget of the trip.

# The project

I developed the project with a team of 3 other students.
We just had a course on PHP, MySQL and JavaScript, so we decided to use these technologies to create the app.
We also used the Bootstrap framework to make the app responsive.
We tried to plan the project as much as possible before starting to code, but we had to adapt a lot of things during the development.
The conception of the interface was done with Figma. It was the first time I used this tool, and I really liked it.

> Afterwards, I had actual courses on Figma, and I realized that I had used it in a very 'basic' way.

# The result

We had a lot of team problems during the development, the team was not very motivated, and we had a lot of problems working together.
We had to redo a lot of things, and we had to adapt a lot of things during the development.
Midway through the project, we added JQuery to the project, and we had to rewrite a lot of things.
I kept the feeling that we could have done a lot better if we had planned the project better, and if we had been more motivated.
At that time, I was just discovering Front-End frameworks with Angular and I wish we took the time to learn it before starting the project.

# Conclusion

I learned a lot of things during this project, I kept for a while the feeling that I wasted my time, but I now realize that I learned a lot of things.
It was mainly a failure but not a waste of time. I learned a lot of things about problems that can occur during a project, and I learned a lot of things about teamwork.
The consequences of this project are that I am now more careful when planning a project, and I am more careful when choosing the technologies to use and people to work with.
