# The purpose of this project

Toffle is a web application made to answer the problem 'What to watch'.
It is an app that involves API, Authentication, JSON Web token and Typescript.
This project was made to discover the framework Angular.
The point of this project was to gain skills and discover something different from Vue that I already knew a bit.
