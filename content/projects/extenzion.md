# Why I made Extenzion ...

During quarantine back in 2021, I started to watch the very cool series called Doctor Who. I pretty much binged watch
the whole show.

Watching episodes after episodes, I found myself forgetting which episode I have to watch next. I had to go back to the
website and check
which episode I had to watch next. I thought to myself, "There must be a better way to do this."

# Why a Chrome extension?

At that time, I had no idea how a Chrome extension worked. I had no idea how to make one. That's exactly why I wanted to
make one.
Plus, I needed just a small piece of information to be displayed so an extension is just made for this.

# How I made Extenzion

It turned out that making a Chrome extension is pretty much like making a website. I used pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
to make Extenzion.
I could have just displayed the episode number and the series number in the extension, but I wanted to make it more ✨<i>
shiny</i>✨.
That's why I added the image of the episode and the title of the episode. I also added a link to the episode on the BBC
website.
I used for this purpose the TMBD API to get every information about the episodes. Using such a powerful API allowed to
use
the extension for any tv show that is on TMBD.
